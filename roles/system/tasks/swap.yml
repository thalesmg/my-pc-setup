# "Note: dynamic space allocation such as using fallocate is not
# supported, as it causes problems with some file systems such as
# F2FS[1] and will likely fail to activate at boot time with error
# "swapon: swapfile has holes" as of kernel 5.7. Hence, contiguous
# allocation, such as dd, is the only reliable way to allocate a swap
# file.[2]"
